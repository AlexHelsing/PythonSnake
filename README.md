# PythonSnake

## What is it?

A simple version of the classic snake game! Use arrow keys to controll the snake and try to beat your own highscore which is saved locally :)

## Technologies used

Python developed in PyCharm, using tkinter for GUI.

## Why?

To practice developing apps and GUI in python. Created it with the help of an online bootcamp/course around 2 years ago when starting to code.

Download the repo, navigate (cd) to the folder and run it by entering "python3 main.py" in terminal
